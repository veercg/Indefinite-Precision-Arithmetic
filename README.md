Indefinite-Precision-Arithmetic

A C Library for exact representation of very large Integers is presented here. 
The representation allows exact computation involving all arithmetic operations on very large Integers(of infinite length). 
Also  functions for different logical operations  have been provided by this library. 

User manual for using this library in Linux environment is also provided at the end.
